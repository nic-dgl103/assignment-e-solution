      <figcaption>In their Home page, it has only introduction,so they don't provide enough information to uses. </figcaption>

         <figcaption>There is no grouped blocks. </figcaption>

         <img src="images/Products&Services.PNG" alt="Difficult_words in Ascent Physiotherapy">
         <figcaption>For example, TMJ is an abbreviation. </figcaption>

        <h3><em>Problem: </em>The size, font weight and colour are not set appropriately.</h3>
        <p>This confuses users which information is important of each page (Ex, “Rate” page)</p>
        <figure>

         <figcaption>There are some kinds of words in Rate page. </figcaption>
